<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m someone who truly loves good food—it’s more than just a necessity for me; it’s an experience. Whether I’m trying out new cuisines or savoring a well-loved dish, food has a way of bringing me joy and excitement like nothing else. Beyond my love for food, music plays a huge role in my life. I have a deep admiration for artists who radiate confidence and individuality, and I’m especially drawn to their energy and presence.

  Cardi B, SZA, and Latto are some of my favorites, not only because their music is amazing but also because they’re unapologetically themselves. Their sexy, confident vibes inspire me, and I love how they own their space. On the other hand, Travis Scott’s music takes me to another world with his incredible beats and lyrics. His creativity is something I really admire. All in all, food and music are two of my biggest loves—they’re how I celebrate life and express who I am.</p>
