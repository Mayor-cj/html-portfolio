                <h2>What is Semo?</h2>
                <p>Semo is a smooth, dough-like dish that is traditionally made from semolina flour (semovita flour) and water. It shares similarities with other popular Nigerian starchy dishes such as pounded yam, fufu, and eba, but it is made from wheat rather than cassava or yam.</p>
                <h4>Key Characteristics of Semo</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Texture:</b> Semo has a smooth, stretchy texture that is soft but firm enough to be molded into balls or served in mounds.</li>
                    <li><b>Appearance:</b> It is typically off-white or cream-colored and has a glossy finish once cooked.</li>
                    <li><b>Taste:</b> Semo has a mild, neutral flavor, which makes it an ideal accompaniment to flavorful, often spicy Nigerian soups.</li>

                <h2>How is Semo Prepared?</h2>
                <p>Preparing Semo is relatively simple and involves only two main ingredients: semovita flour and water. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to prepare semo at home.</p>
                <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Semovita {Semolina} Flour</li>
                    <li>Water</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Preparation Method</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Boil Water:</b> Bring about 2–3 cups of water to a boil in a pot. The amount of water used will depend on the quantity of semo you want to make.</li>
                    <li><b>Add Semovita Flour:</b> Slowly add the semovita flour to the boiling water while stirring constantly with a wooden spoon to avoid lumps. You can adjust the amount of flour depending on how firm or soft you want the semo.</li>
                    <li><b>Stir and Cook:</b> Continue stirring the mixture until it thickens and becomes smooth. The semo will start to pull away from the sides of the pot as it cooks.</li>
                    <li><b>Final Stirring:</b> Once the semo is fully cooked and smooth, reduce the heat and stir for a few more minutes to ensure that it is evenly cooked.</li>
                    <li><b>Serve:</b> Shape the semo into a ball or mound and serve it hot with your favorite Nigerian soup.
